First, we create a symbol table for storing scope,
each scope will store all these symbols and 
declarations within that scope. 

Second step is the most difficult one,
we added check method to every single class which
requires a check method.

We started with AST_STMT's program check file as
the guide instructed and followed the
polyphmorism idea to implement our check method.

We ended up doing the check methods in AST_EXPR last,
which is relatively easier due to the fact that
we have gain the sense of familiarity of writing
all these check methods.

We have encountered a lot of difficulties. The biggest
problem was we ignored to check double declaration with
previous scopes, and we only did check in our current 
scope which resulted in a 10 hour debug time.

Also, we struggle on the implementatin of the stack, and
at last, we have abandoned the idea of stack, and using a 
similar stack approach, but a more intuitive one to 
make the implementation more clear and straight forward.
